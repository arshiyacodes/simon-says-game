Simon's Turn:
The game starts with Simon (the computer) displaying a short sequence of colors.
Player's Turn:
The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the corresponding buttons in the correct order.
Increasing Difficulty:
Each round, Simon adds a new color to the sequence, making it progressively more challenging to remember and repeat.
Mistakes:
If the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button, the game may end or restart, depending on the game mode (strict or normal).
